Solar System Project in Three.js 
=================================

This a 3D rendering of the Solar System in Javascript (Three.js)

In order to view what I have done,
Please just play "SolarSystem.html" file only in

You can also open my "solarSystem.js" file to have access to my code and algorithm.

Please click, hold and drag the mouse to have a different camera scene.
And also use the fov control panel for zooming.

Thanks you and enjoy.
